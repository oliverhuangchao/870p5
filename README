Project No:	6

Project Due date:	Nov. 26th, 2014

--------------------------------------------

Project basic functions:

This project is just the begining of my final work. 

1. Our hero now can use fist to punch the pink bird (press f)

2. He can jump (press w) and crawl (press s)

3. The fist can follow his figure

4. The pink bird will explore after three punches. You can also set it in xml

5. I add a health bar in this game. You can also press F2 to make the bird have unlimited health (each bird has its own health bar)

6. You can press 'F1' to see how to operate this game

7. I add a sound in this game. 

8. I add a object pooling model in this game

9. I add a reset function this game. Press 'r'

10. In order to make the user convenient with my game. I make the hud visiable for ever unless you press F1. So the hud will not disappear after 3s. I believe this design will make sense.

11. You can also press 'e' to make this game more easier.
