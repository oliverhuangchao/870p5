Project basic description:

This project is just the begining of my final work. 
1. I add two different sprite this time: pinkGear which is a flying bird and Rayman which is our hero.
2. Parallax scrolling. So the tree and sky can move seperately.
3. huds. You can press 'm' to see how to operate this game

*****************************
1. Background

In this project, I want to reshow my previous game named "Rayman".  That is a great game and gives me a happy 
childhood. I really want to thanks Ubisoft and their hero 'Rayman'. Also I should thanks Dr. Malloy. It is his great effort that teaches me how to do vedio games.

So this time, I want to use my power to implement it again as a kind of souvenir.

The figure name is 'Rayman'.
*****************************
2. How does he play
run left: press 'a'
run right: press 'd'
jump: press 'w'
crawl: press 'd'

*****************************
3. furture works
a. He can punch his fist to his enemy (maybe achieve it in the furture work)
b. The background can changed which means the user can choose the background. Each background should represent different motif. 
c. What is the style of the game? Our hero can use his fist and jump abaility to get to the final gate to win the success.


PS:

1. The hero Rayman I get from 'http://www.spriters-resource.com/game_boy_advance/raymanadv/sheet/24892/'
